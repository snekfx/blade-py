1. blade data > ‚ùå Error: 'dict' object has no attribute 'startswith'

2. if tree and md5 is available, do a lazy tree scan then compare the md5 to see if any tree changes before walking that way we can use the cached repo information instead of walking again; otherwise just walk

3. blade data should identify internal libraries and their internal org/group so that down stream commands and update views.

4. there should only be one canonical blade help screen (help -h --help)

5. stats and usage show differnt values.

6. 2.0 and 2.0.0 should not be marked as conflicts (need to canonize redundant versions), also alpha rc or other pre release builds should not be treated as latest -- probably should make a note of pre-release build available vs treating it as latest

7. need to parse additional version meta info like v2.0.0-deprecated

8. blade outdated should only list the outdated packages a --more flag can you show in depth view

9. need to clarify the user commands, some seem redundant or inaccurate

10. blade hub should not present rsb or hub as opportunities

11. blade needs proper version command (version -v --version) that works like featpy (uses the ascii logo, and grabs version information from pyproject.toml) help command should also show the logo on the top.
