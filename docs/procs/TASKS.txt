# Active Tasks

Keep this list lean. Only in-progress or ready-to-start items belong here.
See ROADMAP.txt for backlog and strategic work.

## ACTIVE WORK üîÑ

### Priority 1 - Critical Bugs

**[BUGS-02]: Fix stats vs usage showing different values** [3 SP] ‚≠ê HIGH
- Context: Post-migration views still expect legacy sentinels (`path`, `workspace`) and hard-code the hub repo id (103). The new TSV emits `LOCAL`/`WORKSPACE` and assigns repo ids per run, so hub packages are double-counted and sentinel entries poison stats.
- Files: blade.py (stats/usage/hub view helpers)
- Success Criteria:
  - [ ] Views derive hub exclusions from `RepoData`/`LatestData` instead of magic ids/strings.
  - [ ] `blade stats`, `blade usage`, and `blade hub` report aligned counts for packages with hub/local/workspace usage.
  - [ ] Tests cover TSV rows with `LOCAL`/`WORKSPACE` values and ensure metrics remain consistent.

### Priority 2 - Feature/UX Improvements

**[QOL-01]: Optimize tree scanning with md5 caching** [3 SP] ‚≠ê MEDIUM
- Context: If tree and md5 available, compare before walking to use cached repo data
- Files: blade.py (data command), src/scanner.py
- Success Criteria:
  - [ ] md5 comparison logic implemented
  - [ ] Cached data used when md5 matches
  - [ ] Performance improvement measured
  - [ ] Test added

**[QOL-02]: Identify internal libraries and org/group** [3 SP] ‚≠ê MEDIUM
- Context: `blade data` should extract internal lib info for downstream commands
- Files: src/scanner.py, blade.py
- Success Criteria:
  - [ ] Internal libraries identified
  - [ ] Org/group metadata captured
  - [ ] Available in other commands
  - [ ] Documentation updated

**[QOL-03]: Clarify and canonize user commands** [2 SP] ‚≠ê MEDIUM
- Context: Some commands seem redundant or inaccurate
- Files: blade.py (command definitions), docs/
- Success Criteria:
  - [ ] Command overlap analysis complete
  - [ ] Redundancy removed or clarified
  - [ ] Help text updated
  - [ ] Command matrix documented

**[QOL-04]: Improve blade outdated filtering** [2 SP] ‚≠ê MEDIUM
- Context: `blade outdated` should only list outdated packages, with `--more` for details
- Files: blade.py (outdated command)
- Success Criteria:
  - [ ] Default output condensed
  - [ ] --more flag shows detailed view
  - [ ] Tests updated

### Priority 3 - Command-Specific

**[BLADE-01]: Implement proper version command with logo** [2 SP] ‚≠ê MEDIUM
- Context: `blade version -v --version` should show ASCII logo and pull version from pyproject.toml (like featpy)
- Files: blade.py (version command), ASCII logo file
- Requirements:
  - Works with: version, -v, --version flags
  - Display ASCII logo at top
  - Read version from pyproject.toml
  - Help command should also show logo
- Success Criteria:
  - [ ] version command works with all flags
  - [ ] Logo displays in version output
  - [ ] Version read from pyproject.toml correctly
  - [ ] Help screen includes logo
  - [ ] Test added

**[REF-01]: Refactor walker.py to use generic scripts section** [2 SP] ‚≠ê HIGH
- Context: walker special-cases test.sh, build.sh, deploy.sh as "key_scripts"; should be generic
- Files: bin/walker.py
- Requirements:
  - Remove special "key_scripts" tracking (test.sh, build.sh, deploy.sh)
  - Move all scripts to generic "scripts_found" section
  - If test.sh exists, it shows up in scripts (no special meaning)
  - Detect primary language and package structure instead
  - Track pyproject.toml, setup.py presence for Python projects
- Success Criteria:
  - [ ] key_scripts dict removed
  - [ ] All scripts now listed generically
  - [ ] test.sh/build.sh/deploy.sh treated like any other script
  - [ ] Python project detection improved
  - [ ] Tests updated
